// CmdDevice

// Note: The CmdDevice object is meant to be a base class that provides much of 
//       the common functionality needed by many commands. This includes connection
//       of the various sinks a command most likely needs and providing generic
//       implementations of those sinks. Additionally, CmdDevice defines virtual member
//       functions for each event it handles. The generic implementatoin provided by
//       CmdDevice object that Solid Edge invokes in turn calls the analogous virtual
//       member function on itself. Derived classes in many cases will simply
//       override whatever virtual CmdDevice member functions they care to respond to
//       while letting the CmdDevice object handle the other events.
