	// I will add two commands to versions of Solid Edge prior to ST1 (version 20 and earlier). Prior to ST1 an add-in could only call
	// SetAddInInfo (or SetAddInInfoEx when 64 bit support came about) one time and that call resulted in a menu structure being created by Solid Edge. 
	// Tool bars were supported then and calls could be made to create multiple tool bars out of the commands added. With ST1 Solid Edge started 
	// creating groups out of any tool bars created - one group per tool bar since tool bars are no longer part of the user interface. 
	// This allowed for a decent factorization of the add-in's user interface for presentation to the user. Note that a tool bar is also known as
	// a command bar in the API and the buttons are command bar buttons.
	
	// Starting with ST1, multiple calls can be made to SetAddInInfo/SetAddInInfoEx. Each call with a unique category name will cause on group of
	// controls to appear on the ribbon. If the addin specifies that it wants its own tabs, the group appears on a tab that uses the category name.
	// The group uses the same name. If the addin doesn't use its own tabs, the group or groups appear on the "AddIns" tab. To create multiple groups
	// on its own tab, is a bit difficult but it can be done. The tool bars are the key (a.k.a. "command bars" with "command bar buttons" in the API).
	// With ST the command bar name can have two parts, again separated by a new line character. The first part is used to identify the category/tab
	// the on which the group should be created. The second part is the group name. To avoid duplication Solid Edge will replace or remove controls
	// added to the "default" group created when SetAddInInfoEx was called.

	// Starting with ST7, yet another interface was added, ISEAddInEx2 with a SetAddInInfoEx2 interface. This interface has two new features. The
	// category name passed in can be used to directly create both a tab AND a group. And the new API takes in an array of control styles for the
	// controls added to the user interface. Previously one had to use command bar button styles to effect styles such as displaying a control with
	// an icon and text, or displaying a large control with text under the icon or perhaps to create a check box button control or radio button control.
	// That is, with ST7 and later, the command bar button APIs are even less useful and hopefully not even needed. Now let's see how this all comes
	// together to create a user interface.
	
	// For ST1 and later, I show how to add two tabs. I will use the newer SetAddInInfoEx2 for ST7 and later and SetAddInInfoEx for ST1 thru ST6.
	// The first tab will have two groups and the second tab will have one group.

	// A note on command IDs. Use the input IDs in the command event handlers. The ID you pass to SetAddInInfo is the ID passed to the event handlers.
	// Edge will NOT use the input command IDs for the controls created and any window command messages as such IDs need to be unique across the user
	// interface. Hence Solid Edge will generate a unique ID for each input ID and return those IDs added to the UI in the array of IDs (it is both input
	// and output). Use the returned IDs, for example, in calls to the application's StartCommand API or in response to shortcut menu events. Since Solid
	// Edge doesn't know the origin of such calls, and those calls result in Windows posting WM_COMMAND messages, the returned IDs must be used in such
	// calls. However when the WM_COMMAND event is eventually processed, Solid Edge will be able to map the ID in the event to the addin command ID and
	// still invoke the OnCommand event handlers with the addin supplied ID. The order addins load and the fact that macros added by a user also get 
	// assigned a dynamic ID means the IDs returned are only good for the session they are created in.

		// For legacy add-ins (pre-ST), toolbar bitmaps are 24 pixels wide by 23 pixels high 
		// for large buttons and 16 pixels wide by 15 pixels for medium buttons. The background
		// color is (192,192,192). The glyph id passed in identifies the glyphs in the resource 
		// file whose instance handle is hInstance. The number of commands for a legacy add-in
		// does not have to correspond with the width of the glyph. For example, a glyph for a 
		// legacy add-in that passes in two commands can be 48X15 and edge will handle this.
		// For non-legacy add-ins, the glyph size should correspond to the number of commands.
		
		// For ST, only the "medium" (what ever happened to small and large) image is used and ST 
		// really wants a 16X16 image. No big deal if I use the older sizes as Edge will make the 
		// minor adjustment. 
	
		// Starting with ST2 (a.k.a V102), Edge will choose the medium or large image based
		// on the machine's DPI setting. The large image size should be 20X20. But if your add-in
		// wants to run in pre-ST Edge, the 24X23 image will usually appear just fine. The caller 
		// can pass in -1 for any image not provided and Edge will use the image that is passed in 
		// regardless of the DPI setting of the machine and regardless of just how crappy an image 
		// may look after being resized by the UI system.

		// Also, starting with ST MP7, the new capabilities for add-ins to create a UI have been
		// back ported. Besides the above, an add-in can add large images such as those seen for
		// many edge commands. The image size is 32X32 (medium) and (40X40) for large images.

		// One other note concerning the background color of the glyph and how edge tries to 
		// determine if the add-in is a legacy add-in. If the add-in is using the new capabilities 
		// by calling SetAddInInfo multiple times, edge assumes the first
		// pixel of the glyph is the background color of the image (except for PNG
		// images, which don't have a transparent color since they have an alpha plane). If the
		// add-in only makes one call to SetAddInInfo, Edge has an algorithm that is executed to try 
		// and determine if the add-in is a legacy add-in. If your add-in image height is 15 (medium)
		// or 23 (large) with 4 bits per pixel, then edge assumes the add-in is a 
		// "legacy add-in" and will continue to assume the background is (192,192,192). If you have
		// problems with the image transparency, try editing the glyph so that the first pixel of
		// each image is (192,192,192). For instance, I have a sample add-in from an ISV that has no
		// transparent pixels (the background is all red). When passing them to the new UI system,
		// all the red was ignored and the image looked really bad. Setting the first pixel to the
		// background color would fix that issue. Luckily the image was 4 bpp and the new test by
		// edge took care of the problem because edge changes the first pixel to the background
		// color automatically (yes you give up one pixel, which you can see if you zoom in on such
		// an image. But if you are not so lucky (say you don't use 4 bpp), a bit of editing of the image
		// can make a big difference.

		// Edge can be forgiving when it comes to the image height. So an add-in can ignore the
		// early edge image heights of 15 (23) pixels and pass in an image that is 16 (24) pixels
		// high. Not sure where that 15 (23) size came from. I believe it was related to an Office
		// standard.

		// How do I use the newer "Ex" interface? See if it is present. If not, then this is
		// definitely not ST. If it is present, I still don't know if I have ST and in particular
		// a version of ST that supports the new UI enhancements.
